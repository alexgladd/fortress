# Fortress

> Fortress is a zero-dependency library of useful low-level game development utilities written in
> Dart for web and Flutter apps.

Fortress is specifically for retro-style, grid-based games like roguelikes and dwarf fortress, but
could work for anything tile-based with retro/ASCII pixel graphics.

Fortress was heavily influcenced by the the work of [Bob Nystrom](https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/),
both his [writing](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/) and his
[code](https://github.com/munificent). Indeed, many parts of Fortress are reimplementations
of his work on [piecemeal](https://github.com/munificent/piecemeal),
[malison](https://github.com/munificent/malison), and his roguelike
[Hauberk](https://github.com/munificent/hauberk) with my own modifications. This was my opportunity
to learn more about Dart while exploring more of my gamedev hobby.

## Usage

For now, see example usage in [web/main.dart](web/main.dart) and [web/demo](web/demo/).
